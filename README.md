# First_App - 28/11/2018

## Description
It is a Quiz App that has seven questions with four possible answers each. The App displays whether the correct answer was chosen and grants points accordingly.
After completion of the quiz the final score is shown.


## How to play
The first screen has 2 possible buttons.
The first button "SPIELEN" starts the game and the second one "HIGHSCORE" is supposed to show all the previous highscores but i didn't 
program it.

1. By clicking "SPIELEN" you get to the first question with 4 randomly arranged answers and a little score display at the bottom 
   of the screen.
2. After clicking on one of the possible answers the algorithm determines wether it was right or wrong. In case you got the right
   answer you get a point and consequently no point for a wrong answer.
3. If you answered the last (7th) question you get to the "endscreen" which displays your final score at the center of the screen. 
4. To get back to the main menu you just click the button "STARTSEITE"
